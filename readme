Decentralized Health Data Exchange and Consent Management Platform
Overview
This platform enables patients to securely share their health data with healthcare providers and researchers, while maintaining full control over their data consent. By leveraging Hedera's consensus service and token service, the platform ensures data integrity, transparency, and secure consent management.

Impact
The platform enhances patient privacy and data security, facilitating valuable medical research and improved healthcare outcomes. Patients can trust that their data is used ethically and securely, and researchers can access high-quality, consented data.

Use Cases
Patients
Grant and revoke access to their health records
Control who can view and use their health data
Ensure their data is used ethically and securely
Researchers
Access high-quality, consented data for studies
Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations
Conduct valuable medical research with trusted data
Technical Details
Architecture
The platform consists of the following components:

Hedera Consensus Service: Ensures data integrity and transparency
Hedera Token Service: Manages consent tokens for secure data sharing
Decentralized Data Storage: Stores health data securely and decentralized
User Interface: Enables patients and researchers to interact with the platform
Code
The platform is built using the following technologies:

JavaScript (for the user interface and backend logic)
Solidity (for smart contracts on the Hedera network)
Example code snippets:

JavaScript (User Interface)

javascript
Edit
Copy code
// Import necessary libraries
const { HederaClient } = require('@hashgraph/sdk');

// Initialize the Hedera client
const client = new HederaClient({
  network: 'testnet',
  mirrorNodeUrl: 'https://testnet.mirrornode.hedera.com',
});

// Define a function to grant access to a researcher
async function grantAccess(researcherAccountId) {
  // Create a new consent token
  const token = await client.createToken({
    name: 'Consent Token',
    symbol: 'CT',
    treasuryAccountId: patientAccountId,
  });

  // Grant access to the researcher
  await client.grantAccess({
    tokenId: token.id,
    accountId: researcherAccountId,
  });
}
Solidity (Smart Contract)

solidity
Edit
Copy code
// Define a contract for consent management
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract ConsentManager {
  // Mapping of patient account IDs to consent tokens
  mapping(address => mapping(address => bool)) public consentTokens;

  // Function to grant access to a researcher
  function grantAccess(address researcherAccountId) public {
    // Check if the patient has granted access to the researcher
    require(consentTokens[msg.sender][researcherAccountId], 'Access not granted');

    // Grant access to the researcher
    consentTokens[msg.sender][researcherAccountId] = true;
  }
}
